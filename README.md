<-- OUR APP -->

Our team of three has created a web app that manages a shared play queue of songs for a party or event. A user can register to join a party from our database or start their very own party. Users can up or down vote songs in the respective parties they're currently attending to reorder the queue. Each user can vote up or down only once for each song, but can change their mind at any point. 

<-- Running Our App -->

Running this program for the first time will create the local database.
You can simulate multiple users by running the app in multiple windows/tabs.
Music will play out of the Spotify Desktop App (under Charles' account)
